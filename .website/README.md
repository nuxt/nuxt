# Nuxt Docs Website

This is a temporary directory until we open source the repository for nuxt.com.

The goal is to simplify the contribution in the meantine to the documentation by having the possibility to preview the changes locally.

## Setup

Install dependencies in the root of the `nuxt` folder:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then stub the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm build:stub
```

## Development

In the root of the `nuxt` folder, run:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Update the documentation within the `docs` folder.
