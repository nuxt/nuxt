### Why do I need to provide a reproduction?

Reproductions make it possible for us to triage and fix issues quickly with a relatively small team. It helps us discover the source of the problem, and also can reveal assumptions you or we might be making.

### What will happen?

If you've provided a reproduction, we'll remove the label and try to reproduce the issue. If we can, we'll mark it as a bug and prioritise it based on its severity and how many people we think it might affect.

If `needs reproduction` labeled issues don't receive any substantial activity (e.g., new comments featuring a reproduction link), we'll close them. That's not because we don't care! At any point, feel free to comment with a reproduction and we'll reopen it.

### How can I create a reproduction?

We have a couple of templates for starting with a minimal reproduction:

üëâ https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz
üëâ https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/starter/v3-codesandbox

A public GitHub repository is also perfect. üëå

Please ensure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible. See more details [in our guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/community/reporting-bugs/#create-a-minimal-reproduction).
