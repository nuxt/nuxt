# Nuxt.js with Socket.io

An example for Nuxt.js with WebSockets over Sockets.io.

* Do you use Nuxt programatically (eg. with Express or Koa)? Take a look into [`server.js`](./server.js) for setting up WS with your implementation

* In case you use Nuxt standalone, check out [`nuxt.config.js`](./nuxt.config.js) and the [io-module](./io/index.js)

* In both situations you should look into the [`index.vue`](./pages/index.vue) where sending and receiving messages is done
