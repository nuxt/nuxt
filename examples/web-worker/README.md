In nuxt 1.4 and below you have to create a production build to use web workers.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
# nuxt 1.4 and below does not support web workers in dev mode
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
# in nuxt 1.4 and below you have to create a production build to use web workers
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
