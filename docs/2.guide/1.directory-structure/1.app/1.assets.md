The directory usually contains the following types of files:

- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't be served from the [`public/`](/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.

If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend taking a look at the [`public/`](/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/public) directory.
