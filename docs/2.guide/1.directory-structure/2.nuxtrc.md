The `.nuxtrc` file can be used to configure Nuxt with a flat syntax. It is based on [`unjs/rc9`](https://github.com/unjs/rc9).

::tip
For more advanced configurations, use [`nuxt.config`](/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config).
::

## Usage

```bash [.nuxtrc]
# Disable SSR
ssr=false

# Configuration for `@nuxt/devtools`
devtools.enabled=true

# Add Nuxt modules
modules[]=@nuxt/image
modules[]=nuxt-security
```

If present, the properties in the `nuxt.config` file will overwrite the properties in `.nuxtrc` file.

::note
Nuxt automatically adds a `setups` section to track module installation and upgrade state. This is used internally for [module lifecycle hooks](/docs/4.x/api/kit/modules#using-lifecycle-hooks-for-module-installation-and-upgrade) and should not be modified manually.

## Global `.nuxtrc` File

You can also create a global `.nuxtrc` file in your home directory to apply configurations globally.

- On macOS/Linux, this file is located at:

  ```md
  ~/.nuxtrc
  ```

- On Windows, it is located at:

  ```md
  C:\Users\{username}\.nuxtrc
  ```

This global `.nuxtrc` file allows you to define default settings that apply to all Nuxt projects on your system. However, project-level `.nuxtrc` files will override these global settings, and `nuxt.config` will take precedence over both.
