## What is LLMs.txt?

LLMs.txt is a structured documentation format specifically designed for large language models (LLMs). Nuxt provides LLMs.txt files that contain comprehensive information about the framework, making it easy for AI tools to understand and assist with Nuxt development.

These files are optimized for AI consumption and contain structured information about concepts, APIs, usage patterns, and best practices.

## Available routes

We provide LLMs.txt routes to help AI tools access our documentation:

- **`/llms.txt`** - Contains a structured overview of all documentation pages and their links (~5K tokens)
- **`/llms-full.txt`** - Provides comprehensive documentation including getting started guides, API references, blog posts, and deployment guides (~1M+ tokens)

## Choosing the Right File

::note{icon="i-lucide-info"}
**Most users should start with `/llms.txt`** - it contains all essential information and works with standard LLM context windows.

Use `/llms-full.txt` only if you need comprehensive implementation details and your AI tool supports large contexts (200K+ tokens).

## Important usage notes

::warning{icon="i-lucide-alert-triangle"}
**@-symbol must be typed manually** - When using tools like Cursor or Windsurf, the `@` symbol must be typed by hand in the chat interface. Copy-pasting breaks the tool's ability to recognize it as a context reference.
