## ESLint

The recommended approach for Nuxt is to enable ESLint support using the [`@nuxt/eslint`](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module) module, that will setup project-aware ESLint configuration for you.

:::callout{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb"}
The module is designed for the [new ESLint flat config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new) with is the [default format since ESLint v9](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/). If you are using the legacy `.eslintrc` config, you will need to [configure manually with `@nuxt/eslint-config`](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/config#legacy-config-format). We highly recommend you to migrate over the flat config to be future-proof.

## Quick Setup

```bash
npx nuxt module add eslint
```

Start your Nuxt app, a `eslint.config.mjs` file will be generated under your project root. You can customize it as needed.

You can learn more about the module and customizations in [Nuxt ESLint's documentation](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module).
