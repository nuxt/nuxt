## Type-checking

By default, Nuxt doesn't check types when you run [`nuxt dev`](/docs/api/commands/dev) or [`nuxt build`](/docs/api/commands/build), for performance reasons.

To enable type-checking at build or development time, install `vue-tsc` and `typescript` as development dependency:

::code-group{sync="pm"}

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install --save-dev vue-tsc typescript
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn add --dev vue-tsc typescript
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm add -D vue-tsc typescript
  ```

  ```bash [bun]
  bun add -D vue-tsc typescript
  ```

::

Then, run [`nuxt typecheck`](/docs/api/commands/typecheck) command to check your types:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxt typecheck
```

To enable type-checking at build or development time, you can also use the [`typescript.typeCheck`](/docs/api/nuxt-config#typecheck) option in your `nuxt.config` file:

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  typescript: {
    typeCheck: true
  }
})
```

## Auto-generated Types

When you run `nuxt dev` or `nuxt build`, Nuxt generates the following files for IDE type support (and type checking):

### `.nuxt/nuxt.d.ts`

This file contains the types of any modules you are using, as well as the key types that Nuxt requires. Your IDE should recognize these types automatically.

Some of the references in the file are to files that are only generated within your `buildDir` (`.nuxt`) and therefore for full typings, you will need to run `nuxt dev` or `nuxt build`.

### `.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json`

This file contains the recommended basic TypeScript configuration for your project, including resolved aliases injected by Nuxt or modules you are using, so you can get full type support and path auto-complete for aliases like `~/file` or `#build/file`.

::note
Consider using the `imports` section of [nuxt.config](/docs/api/nuxt-config#imports) to include directories beyond the default ones. This can be useful for auto-importing types which you're using across your app.

::note
Nitro also [auto-generates types](/docs/guide/concepts/server-engine#typed-api-routes) for API routes. Plus, Nuxt also generates types for globally available components and [auto-imports from your composables](/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables), plus other core functionality.
::

::note
For backward compatibility, Nuxt still generates `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json`. However, we recommend using [TypeScript project references](/docs/guide/directory-structure/tsconfig) with the new configuration files (`.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json`, `.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json`, etc.) for better type safety and performance.

If you do extend from `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json`, keep in mind that all options will be overwritten by those defined in your `tsconfig.json`. Overwriting options such as `"compilerOptions.paths"` with your own configuration will lead TypeScript to not factor in the module resolutions, which can cause module resolutions such as `#imports` to not be recognized.

In case you need to extend options further, you can use the [`alias` property](/docs/api/nuxt-config#alias) within your `nuxt.config`. Nuxt will pick them up and extend the generated TypeScript configurations accordingly.

## Project References

Nuxt uses [TypeScript project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) to improve type-checking performance and provide better IDE support. This feature allows TypeScript to break up your codebase into smaller, more manageable pieces.

### How Nuxt Uses Project References

When you run `nuxt dev` or `nuxt build`, Nuxt will generate multiple `tsconfig.json` files for different parts of your application.

- **`.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json`** - Configuration for your application code
- **`.nuxt/tsconfig.node.json`** - Configuration for your `nuxt.config` and modules
- **`.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json`** - Configuration for server-side code (when applicable)
- **`.nuxt/tsconfig.json`** - Legacy configuration for backward compatibility

Each of these files is configured to reference the appropriate dependencies and provide optimal type-checking for their specific context.

### Benefits of Project References

- **Faster builds**: TypeScript can skip rebuilding unchanged projects
- **Better IDE performance**: Your IDE can provide faster IntelliSense and error checking
- **Isolated compilation**: Errors in one part of your application don't prevent compilation of other parts
- **Clearer dependency management**: Each project explicitly declares its dependencies

::note
The project reference setup is handled automatically by Nuxt. You typically don't need to modify these configurations manually, but understanding how they work can help you troubleshoot type-checking issues.

## Strict Checks

TypeScript comes with certain checks to give you more safety and analysis of your program.

[Strict checks](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html#getting-stricter-checks) are enabled by default in Nuxt to give you greater type safety.

If you are currently converting your codebase to TypeScript, you may want to temporarily disable strict checks by setting `strict` to `false` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  typescript: {
    strict: false
  }
})
```
