title: 'Nuxt Lifecycle'
description: "Understanding the lifecycle of Nuxt applications can help you gain deeper insights into how the framework operates, especially for both server-side and client-side rendering."
---

The goal of this chapter is to provide a high-level overview of the different parts of the framework, their execution order, and how they work together.

## Server Side

For Server side, the following steps are executed for every initial request to your application:

### Step 1: Setup Nitro Server and Nitro Plugins (Once)

Nuxt is powered by [Nitro](https://nitro.build/), a modern server engine.

When Nitro starts, it initializes and executes the plugins under the `/server/plugins` directory. These plugins can:
- Capture and handle application-wide errors.
- Register hooks that execute when Nitro shuts down.
- Register hooks for request lifecycle events, such as modifying responses.

::note
Nitro plugins are executed only once when the server starts.

### Step 2: Nitro Server Middleware

After initializing the Nitro server, middleware under `/server/middleware` is executed for every request. Middleware can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, or request transformation.

::note
Returning a value from middleware will terminate the request and send the returned value as the response. This behavior should generally be avoided to ensure proper request handling!

### Step 3: Initial Nuxt and Execute Nuxt Server Plugins

The Vue and Nuxt instances are created first. Afterward, Nuxt executes its plugins. This includes:
- Built-in plugins, such as Vue Router and `unhead`.
- Custom plugins located in the `plugins/` directory, including those without a suffix (e.g., `myPlugin.ts`) and those with the `.server` suffix (e.g., `myServerPlugin.server.ts`).

Plugins execute in a specific order and may have dependencies on one another. For more details, including execution order and parallelism, refer to the [Plugins documentation](/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins).

::note
After this step, Nuxt calls the [`app:created`](/docs/api/advanced/hooks#app-hooks-runtime) hook, which can be used to execute additional logic.

### Step 4: Route Validation

After initializing plugins and before executing middleware, Nuxt calls the `validate` method if it is defined in the `definePageMeta` function. The `validate` method, which can be synchronous or asynchronous, is often used to validate dynamic route parameters.

- The `validate` function should return `true` if the parameters are valid.
- If validation fails, it should return `false` or an object containing a `statusCode` and/or `statusMessage` to terminate the request.

For more information, see the [Route Validation documentation](/docs/getting-started/routing#route-validation).

### Step 5: Execute Nuxt Middleware

Middleware allows you to run code before navigating to a particular route. It is often used for tasks such as authentication, redirection, or logging.

In Nuxt, there are three types of middleware:
- **Global route middleware**
- **Named route middleware**
- **Anonymous (or inline) route middleware**

Nuxt automatically executes global middleware for every route navigation. Named and anonymous middleware are executed only on the routes specified in the middleware property of the page(route) meta defined in the corresponding page components.

For details about each type and examples, see the [Middleware documentation](/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware).

### Step 6: Setup Page and Components

Nuxt initializes the page and its components during this step and fetches any required data. Since no DOM operations occur on the server, Vue lifecycle hooks such as `onBeforeMount`, `onMounted`, and subsequent hooks are **not executed** during SSR.

### Step 7: Render Page and Generate HTML Output

After all components are initialized and data is fetched, Nuxt combines the components with settings from `unhead` to generate a complete HTML document. This HTML, along with the associated data, is sent back to the client to complete the SSR process.

::note
Before finalizing and sending the HTML, Nuxt triggers the `render:html` hook. This hook allows you to manipulate the generated HTML, such as injecting additional scripts or modifying meta tags.
