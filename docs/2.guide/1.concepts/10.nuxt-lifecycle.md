title: 'Nuxt Lifecycle'
description: "Understanding the lifecycle of Nuxt applications can help you gain deeper insights into how the framework operates, especially for both server-side and client-side rendering."
---

The goal of this chapter is to provide a high-level overview of the different parts of the framework, their execution order, and how they work together.

## Server Side

For SSR, the following steps are executed for every initial request to your application:

### Step 1: Execute Server Plugins

After creating the Vue and Nuxt instances, Nuxt executes the server plugins. This includes:
- Built-in plugins, such as Vue Router and `unhead`.
- Custom plugins located in the `plugins/` directory, including those without a suffix (e.g., `myPlugin.ts`) and those with the `.server` suffix (e.g., `myServerPlugin.server.ts`).

Plugins are executed in a specific order and can depend on one another. For more details, including execution order and parallelism, refer to the [Plugins documentation](/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins).

::note
After this step, Nuxt calls the [`app:created`](/docs/api/advanced/hooks#app-hooks-runtime) hook, which can be used to execute additional logic.

### Step 2: Route Validation

After initializing plugins and before executing middleware, Nuxt calls the `validate` method if it is defined in the `definePageMeta` function. The `validate` method can be synchronous or asynchronous and is commonly used to validate dynamic route parameters.

- The `validate` function should return `true` if the parameters are valid.
- If validation fails, it should return `false` or an object containing a `statusCode` and/or `statusMessage` to terminate the request.

For more information, see the [Route Validation documentation](/docs/getting-started/routing#route-validation).

### Step 3: Execute Middleware

Middleware allows you to run code before navigating to a particular route. It is often used for tasks such as authentication, redirection, or logging.

In Nuxt, there are three types of middleware:
- **Global route middleware**
- **Named route middleware**
- **Anonymous (or inline) route middleware**

Nuxt automatically executes global middleware for every route navigation. Named and anonymous middleware are executed only on the routes specified in the middleware property of the page(route) meta defined in the corresponding page components.

For details about each type and examples, see the [Middleware documentation](/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware).

### Step 4: Setup Page and Components

Nuxt initializes the page and its components during this step and fetches any required data. Since no DOM operations occur on the server, Vue lifecycle hooks such as `onBeforeMount`, `onMounted`, and subsequent hooks are **not executed** during SSR.

### Step 5: Render Page and Generate HTML Output

After all components are initialized and data is fetched, Nuxt combines the components with settings from `unhead` to generate a complete HTML document. This HTML, along with the associated data, is sent back to the client to complete the SSR process.
