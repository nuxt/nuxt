Some features of Nuxt are available on an opt-in basis, or can be disabled based on your needs.

## `features`

### inlineStyles

Inlines styles when rendering HTML. This is currently available only when using Vite.

You can also pass a function that receives the path of a Vue component and returns a boolean indicating whether to inline the styles for that component.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export defineNuxtConfig({
  features: {
    inlineStyles: true // or a function to determine inlining
  }
})
```

### noScripts

Disables rendering of Nuxt scripts and JS resource hints. Can also be configured granularly within `routeRules`.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export defineNuxtConfig({
  features: {
    noScripts: true
  }
})
```

## `future`

There is also a `future` namespace for early opting-in to new features that will become default in a future (possibly major) version of the framework.

### typescriptBundlerResolution

This enables 'Bundler' module resolution mode for TypeScript, which is the recommended setting
for frameworks like Nuxt and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/performance.html#reduce-resolve-operations).

It improves type support when using modern libraries with `exports`.

See [the original TypeScript pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/51669).

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export defineNuxtConfig({
  future: {
    typescriptBundlerResolution: true
  }
})
```
