Some features of Nuxt are available on an opt-in basis, or can be disabled based on your needs.

## inlineStyles

Inlines styles when rendering HTML. This is currently available only when using Vite.

You can also pass a function that receives the path of a Vue component and returns a boolean indicating whether to inline the styles for that component.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export defineNuxtConfig({
  features: {
    inlineStyles: true // or a function to determine inlining
  }
})
```
