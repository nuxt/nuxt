# Utils Directory

Nuxt 3 uses the `utils/` directory to automatically import helper functions and other utilities throughout your application using [auto-imports](/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports)!

::alert{type=info}
The main purpose of the `utils/` directory is to allow a semantic distinction between your Vue composables and other auto-imported utility functions.

The way `utils/` auto-imports work and are scanned is identical to [the composables/ directory](/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables). You can see examples and more information about how they work in that section of the docs.

These utils are only available within the Vue part of your app. Within the [server directory](/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-utilities), we auto import exported functions and variables from `~/server/utils` instead.
