[Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com) reads the [`content/` directory](/docs/guide/directory-structure/content) in your project and parses `.md`, `.yml`, `.csv` and `.json` files to create a file-based CMS for your application.

- Render your content with built-in components.
- Query your content with a MongoDB-like API.
- Use your Vue components in Markdown files with the MDC syntax.
- Automatically generate your navigation.

## Enable Nuxt Content

Install the `@nuxt/content` module in your project as well as adding it to your `nuxt.config.ts` with one command:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi module add content
```

## Create Content

Place your markdown files inside the `content/` directory:

```md [content/index.md]
# Hello Content
```

The module automatically loads and parses them.

## Render Content

To render content pages, add a [catch-all route](/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages/#catch-all-route) using the [`<ContentDoc>`](https://content.nuxt.com/components/content-doc) component:

```vue [pages/[...slug\\].vue]
<template>
  <main>
    <ContentDoc :path="$route.path" />
  </main>
</template>
```
