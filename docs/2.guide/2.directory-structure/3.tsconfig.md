Nuxt [automatically generates](/docs/guide/concepts/typescript) multiple TypeScript configuration files (`.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json`, `.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json`, `.nuxt/tsconfig.node.json`) with the resolved aliases you are using in your Nuxt project, as well as with other sensible defaults.

You can benefit from this by creating a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project with the following content:

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.app.json"
    },
    {
      "path": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json"
    },
    {
      "path": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.node.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

::note
As you need to, you can customize the contents of this file. However, it is recommended that you don't overwrite `target`, `module` and `moduleResolution`.

::note
If you need to customize your `paths`, this will override the auto-generated path aliases. Instead, we recommend that you add any path aliases you need to the [`alias`](/docs/api/nuxt-config#alias) property within your `nuxt.config`, where they will get picked up and added to the auto-generated `tsconfig`.
