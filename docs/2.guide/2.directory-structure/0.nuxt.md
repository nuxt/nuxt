This directory should be added to your [`.gitignore`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/gitignore) file to avoid pushing the dev build output to your repository.

This directory is interesting if you want to learn more about the files Nuxt generates based on your directory structure.

Nuxt also provides a Virtual File System (VFS) for modules to add templates to this directory without writing them to disk.

You can explore the generated files by opening the [Nuxt DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com) in development mode and navigating to the **Virtual Files** tab.

You should not touch any files inside since the whole directory will be re-created when running [`nuxt dev`](/docs/api/commands/dev).
