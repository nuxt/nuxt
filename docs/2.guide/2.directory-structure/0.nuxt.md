# .nuxt Directory

Nuxt uses the [`.nuxt/` directory](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt) in development to generate your Vue application.

You should not touch any files inside since the whole directory will be re-created when running `nuxt dev`.

This directory is interesting if you want to learn more about the files Nuxt generates based on your directory structure.

## Virtual File System

Nuxt also provides a Virtual File System (VFS) for modules to add templates to this directory without writing them to disk. You can explore the generated files by navigating to <http://localhost:3000/_vfs>
