# Modules Directory

Nuxt automatically reads the top-level files in your `modules/` directory and loads them before starting. It is a good place to place any local modules you develop while building your application.

These files are auto-registered, so you do not need to add them to your `nuxt.config` separately.

::alert{type=warning}
Only files at the top level of the `modules/` directory will be automatically registered.
