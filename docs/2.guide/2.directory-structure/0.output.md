# Output Directory

Nuxt creates the [`.output/` directory](/docs/guide/directory-structure/output) when building your application for production.

::alert{type=warning}
You should not touch any files inside since the whole directory will be re-created when running `nuxt build`.
::

Use this directory to deploy your Nuxt application to production. Learn more in our [deployment section](/docs/getting-started/deployment).
