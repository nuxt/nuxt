Nuxt automatically imports any directive in this directory (along with directives that are registered by any modules you may be using).

```bash [Directory Structure]
| directives/
--| awesome.ts
--| focus.ts
```

```html [app.vue]
<template>
  <div v-awesome v-focus>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Directives

You must use always named exports for your directives.

If you have SSR enabled, you must use object notation in your directives. Otherwise, Vue will throw an error about missing `getSSRProps`.

```ts
function mounted (el: HTMLElement, binding: TouchDirectiveBinding) {
  // ...
}

// other lifecycle hooks

export const Focus = {
  mounted
  // ...
}

// DONT' USE export default here
export default Focus
```
