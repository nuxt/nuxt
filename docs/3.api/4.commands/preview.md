```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi preview [OPTIONS] [ROOTDIR]
```

The `preview` command starts a server to preview your Nuxt application after running the `build` command. The `start` command is an alias for `preview`. When running your application in production refer to the [Deployment section](/docs/getting-started/deployment).

## Arguments

Argument | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
`ROOTDIR="."` | `.` | (DEPRECATED) Use `--cwd` instead. Specifies the working directory, defaults to current directory (".")

## Options

Option | Default | Description
--- | --- | ---
`--cwd=<directory>` |  | Specify the working directory, falls back to ROOTDIR if unset (defaults to current directory (".") after ROOTDIR argument removal)
`--logLevel=<silent\|info\|verbose>` |  | Specify build-time log level
`--envName` |  | The environment to use when resolving configuration overrides (default is `production` when building, and `development` when running the dev server)
`--dotenv` |  | Path to `.env` file to load, relative to the root directory

This command sets `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `production`. To override, define `NODE_ENV` in a `.env` file or as command-line argument.

::note
For convenience, in preview mode, your [`.env`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/env) file will be loaded into `process.env`. (However, in production you will need to ensure your environment variables are set yourself.)
