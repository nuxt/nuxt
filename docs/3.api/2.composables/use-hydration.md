::note
This is an advanced composable and is mostly used by Nuxt modules.
::

::note
`useHydration` is designed to **ensure state synchronization and restoration during SSR**. If you need to create a globally reactive state that is SSR-friendly in Nuxt, [`useState`](/docs/api/composables/use-state) is the recommended choice.
::

`useHydration` is a built-in composable that provides a way to set data on the server side every time a new HTTP request is made and receive that data on the client side. This way `useHydration` allows you to take full control of the hydration cycle.

The data returned from the `get` function on the server is stored in `nuxtApp.payload` under the unique key provided as the first parameter to `useHydration`. During hydration, this data is then retrieved on the client, preventing redundant computations or API calls.

`useHydration()` can be used within composables, plugins, and components.

## Usage

::code-group

```ts [Without useHydration]
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  const myStore = new MyStore()

  if (import.meta.server) {
    nuxt.hooks.hook('app:rendered', () => {
      nuxtApp.payload.myStoreState = myStore.getState()
    })
  }

  if (import.meta.client) {
    nuxt.hooks.hook('app:created', () => {
      myStore.setState(nuxtApp.payload.myStoreState)
    })
  }
})
```

```ts [With useHydration]
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  const myStore = new MyStore()

  useHydration(
    'myStoreState', 
    () => myStore.getState(), 
    (data) => myStore.setState(data)
  )
})
```
::

## Type

```ts [signature]
useHydration <T> (key: string, get: () => T, set: (value: T) => void) => void
```

## Parameters

- `key`: A unique key that identifies the data in your Nuxt application.
- `get`: A function executed **only on the server** (called when SSR rendering is done) to set the initial value.
- `set`: A function executed **only on the client** (called when initial vue instance is created) to receive the data.
