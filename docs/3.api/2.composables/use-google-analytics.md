The `useGoogleAnalytics` composable function allows you to include [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) in your Nuxt application.

::callout
If Google Tag Manager is already included in your application, you can configure Google Analytics directly using it, rather than including Google Analytics as a separate component. Refer to the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/tag-options#what-is-gtm) to learn more about the differences between Tag Manager and gtag.js.
::

## Minimal Example

```vue
<script setup>
useGoogleAnalytics({ id: 'GA-123456789-1' })
</script>
```

## Example with custom event

```vue
<script setup>
const { $script } = useGoogleAnalytics({
  id: 'GA-123456789-1',
})

$script.waitForLoad().then(({ gtag }) => {
  gtag('event', 'some_custom_event', { time: new Date() })
})
</script>
```

## Type

```ts
useGoogleAnalytics(options: ThirdPartyScriptOptions<GoogleAnalyticsOptions, GoogleAnalyticsApi>): ThirdPartyScriptApi<GoogleAnalyticsApi>
```

## Params

An object containing the following options:

- `id`: Google Analytics [measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356).
  - **type**: `string`
  - **required**

## Return Values

An object that contains a special `$script` property that gives you access to the underlying script instance.

- `$script.waitForLoad`: A promise that resolves when the script is ready to use. It exposes `gtag` and `dataLayer`, which lets you interact with the API.
