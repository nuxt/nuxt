When prerendering, you can hint to Nitro to prerender additional paths, even if their URLs do not show up in the HTML of the generated page.

::important
`prerenderRoutes` can only be called within the [Nuxt context](/docs/guide/going-further/nuxt-app#the-nuxt-context).
::

::note
`prerenderRoutes` has to be executed during prerendering. If the `prerenderRoutes` is used in dynamic pages/routes which are not prerendered, then it will not be executed.
::

```js
const route = useRoute()

prerenderRoutes('/')
prerenderRoutes(['/', '/about'])
```

::note
In the browser, or if called outside prerendering, `prerenderRoutes` will have no effect.
::

You can even prerender API routes which is particularly useful for full statically generated sites (SSG) because you can then `$fetch` data as if you have an available server!

```js
prerenderRoutes('/api/content/article/name-of-article')

// Somewhere later in App
const articleContent = await $fetch('/api/content/article/name-of-article', {
  responseType: 'json',
})
```

::warning
Prerendered API routes in production may not return the expected response headers, depending on the provider you deploy to. For example, a JSON response might be served with an `application/octet-stream` content type.
Always manually set `responseType` when fetching prerendered API routes.
