`refreshNuxtData` is used to refetch all or specific `asyncData` instances, including those from [`useAsyncData`](/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-async-data), [`useLazyAsyncData`](/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-lazy-async-data), [`useFetch`](/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-fetch), and [`useLazyFetch`](/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-lazy-fetch).  

::note
If your component is cached by `<KeepAlive>` and enters a deactivated state, the `asyncData` inside the component will still be refetched until the component is unmounted.
::

## Type

```ts twoslash
import { refreshNuxtData } from '#imports'
//        ^?
```

## Parameters

* `keys`: A single string or an array of strings as `keys` that are used to fetch the data. This parameter is **optional**. All [`useAsyncData`](/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-async-data) and [`useFetch`](/docs/4.x/api/composables/use-fetch) keys are re-fetched when no `keys` are explicitly specified.

## Return Values

`refreshNuxtData` returns a promise, resolving when all or specific `asyncData` instances have been refreshed.

## Examples

### Refresh All Data

This example below refreshes all data being fetched using `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` in Nuxt application.

```vue [app/pages/some-page.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const refreshing = ref(false)

async function refreshAll () {
  refreshing.value = true
  try {
    await refreshNuxtData()
  } finally {
    refreshing.value = false
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button
      :disabled="refreshing"
      @click="refreshAll"
    >
      Refetch All Data
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Refresh Specific Data

This example below refreshes only data where the key matches to `count` and `user`.

```vue [app/pages/some-page.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const refreshing = ref(false)

async function refresh () {
  refreshing.value = true
  try {
    // you could also pass an array of keys to refresh multiple data
    await refreshNuxtData(['count', 'user'])
  } finally {
    refreshing.value = false
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="refreshing">
    Loading
  </div>
  <button @click="refresh">
    Refresh
  </button>
</template>
```

::note
If you have access to the `asyncData` instance, it is recommended to use its `refresh` or `execute` method as the preferred way to refetch the data.
