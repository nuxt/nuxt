`onNuxtReady` only runs on the client-side. :br
It is ideal for running code that should not block the initial rendering of your app.
::

```ts [plugins/ready.client.ts]
export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
  onNuxtReady(async () => {
    const myAnalyticsLibrary = await import('my-big-analytics-library')
    // do something with myAnalyticsLibrary
  })
})
```

It is 'safe' to run even after your app has initialized. In this case, then the code will be registered to run in the next idle callback.
