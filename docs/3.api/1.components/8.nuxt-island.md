When rendering an island component, the content of the island component is static, thus no JS is downloaded client-side.

Changing the island component props triggers a refetch of the island component to re-render it again.

::read-more{to="/docs/guide/going-further/experimental-features#componentislands" icon="i-ph-star-duotone"}
This component is experimental and in order to use it you must enable the `experimental.componentIslands` option in your `nuxt.config`.

::callout
Global styles of your application are sent with the response.
::

::callout
Server only components use `<NuxtIsland>` under the hood

## Props

- `name` : Name of the component to render.
  - **type**: `string`
  - **required**
- `lazy`: Make the component non-blocking.
  - **type**: `boolean`
  - **default**: `false`
- `props`: Props to send to the component to render.
  - **type**: `Record<string, any>`
- `source`: Remote source to call the island to render.
  - **type**: `string`

::callout{color="blue" icon="i-ph-info-duotone"}
Remote islands need `experimental.componentIslands` to be `'local+remote'` in your `nuxt.config`.
::

## Slots

Slots can be passed to an island component if declared.

Every slot is interactive since the parent component is the one providing it.

Some slots are reserved to `NuxtIsland` for special cases.

- `#fallback`: Specify the content to be rendered before the island loads (if the component is lazy) or if `NuxtIsland` fails to fetch the component.
