When rendering an island component, the content of the island component is static, thus no JS is downloaded client-side.

Changing the island component props triggers a refetch of the island component to re-render it again.

This component is experimental and in order to use it you must enable the `experimental.componentIslands` option in your `nuxt.config`.
::

::note
Global styles of your application are sent with the response.
::

::tip
Server only components use `<NuxtIsland>` under the hood
::

## Props

- `name` : Name of the component to render.
  - **type**: `string`
  - **required**
- `lazy`: Make the component non-blocking.
  - **type**: `boolean`
  - **default**: `false`
- `props`: Props to send to the component to render.
  - **type**: `Record<string, any>`
- `source`: Remote source to call the island to render.
  - **type**: `string`
- **dangerouslyLoadClientComponents**: Required to load components from a remote source.
  - **type**: `boolean`
  - **default**: `false`

::note
Remote islands need `experimental.componentIslands` to be `'local+remote'` in your `nuxt.config`.
It is strongly discouraged to enable `dangerouslyLoadClientComponents` as you can't trust a remote server's javascript.
::

## Slots

Slots can be passed to an island component if declared.

Every slot is interactive since the parent component is the one providing it.

Some slots are reserved to `NuxtIsland` for special cases.

- `#fallback`: Specify the content to be rendered before the island loads (if the component is lazy) or if `NuxtIsland` fails to fetch the component.

## Ref

- `refresh()`
  - **type**: `() => Promise<void>`
  - **description**: force refetch the server component by refetching it.
