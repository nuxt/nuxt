## Usage

Add `<NuxtRouteAnnouncer/>` in your [`app.vue`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/app) or [`layouts/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts).

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <NuxtRouteAnnouncer />
  <NuxtLayout>
    <NuxtPage />
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>
```

## Slots

You can pass custom HTML or components through the route announcer default slot.

```vue
  <template>
    <NuxtRouteAnnouncer>
      <template #default="{ message }">
        <p>{{ message }} was loaded.</p>
      </template>
    </NuxtRouteAnnouncer>
  </template>
```

## Props

- `atomic`: Controls if screen readers announce only changes or the entire content. Set to true for full content readout on updates, false for changes only. (default `false`)
- `politeness`: Sets the urgency for screen reader announcements: `off` (disable the announcement), `polite` (waits for silence), or `assertive` (interrupts immediately). (default `polite`)

::callout
This component is optional. :br
To achieve full customization, you can implement your own one based on [its source code](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/main/packages/nuxt/src/app/components/nuxt-route-announcer.ts).
::

::callout
You can hook into the underlying announcer instance using [the `useRouteAnnouncer` composable](/docs/api/composables/use-route-announcer), which will allow you to set custom announce message.
