`<NuxtPicture>` is a drop-in replacement for the native `<picture>` tag.

Usage of `<NuxtPicture>` is almost identical to [`<NuxtImg>`](/docs/api/components/nuxt-img) but it also allows serving modern formats like `webp` when possible.

Learn more about the [`<picture>` tag on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture).

## Setup

In order to use `<NuxtPicture>` you should install and enable the Nuxt Image module:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxt module add image
```
