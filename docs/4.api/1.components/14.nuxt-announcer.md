::important
This component is available in Nuxt v3.17+.
::

## Usage

Add `<NuxtAnnouncer/>` in your [`app.vue`](/docs/directory-structure/app) or [`app/layouts/`](/docs/directory-structure/layouts) to enable announcing dynamic content changes to screen readers. This is useful for form validation, toast notifications, loading states, and other in-page updates.

```vue [app/app.vue]
<template>
  <NuxtAnnouncer />
  <NuxtRouteAnnouncer />
  <NuxtLayout>
    <NuxtPage />
  </NuxtLayout>
</template>
```

Then use the [`useAnnouncer`](/docs/api/composables/use-announcer) composable anywhere in your app to announce messages:

```vue [app/pages/contact.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { polite, assertive } = useAnnouncer()

async function submitForm() {
  try {
    await $fetch('/api/contact', { method: 'POST', body: formData })
    polite('Message sent successfully')
  } catch (error) {
    assertive('Error: Failed to send message')
  }
}
</script>
```

## Slots

You can pass custom HTML or components through the announcer's default slot.

```vue
<template>
  <NuxtAnnouncer>
    <template #default="{ message }">
      <p>{{ message }}</p>
    </template>
  </NuxtAnnouncer>
</template>
```

## Props

- `atomic`: Controls if screen readers announce only changes or the entire content. Set to true for full content readouts on updates, false for changes only. (default `true`)
- `politeness`: Sets the default urgency for screen reader announcements: `off` (disable the announcement), `polite` (waits for silence), or `assertive` (interrupts immediately). (default `polite`)

| **Trigger** | Automatic on navigation | Manual via `polite()`/`assertive()` |
| **Message source** | Page `<title>` | Developer-provided |
| **atomic default** | `false` | `true` |
