# Roadmap

Nuxt is constantly evolving, with new features and modules being added all the time.

See [our blog](/blog) for the latest framework and ecosystem announcements.

## üìù Status Reports

- [Documentation Progress](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/13653)
- [Rendering Optimizations: Today and Tomorrow](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/16119)
- [Nuxt Image: Performance and Status](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/16119)

### Release Cycle

Since January 2023, we've adopted a consistent release cycle for **Nuxt 3**, following [semver](https://semver.org/). We aim for major framework releases every year, with an expectation of patch releases every week or so and minor releases every month or so. They should never contain breaking changes except within options clearly marked as `experimental`.

### Current Packages

The current active version of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) is **v3** which is available as `nuxt` on npm with the `latest` tag.

Nuxt 2 is in maintenance mode and is available on npm with the `2x` tag. It will reach End of Life (EOL) on December 31st, 2023 at the same time as Vue 2 does.

Each version has its own edge releases which are generated automatically. For more about enabling the Nuxt 3 edge channel, see [the edge channel docs](/docs/guide/going-further/edge-channel/).
