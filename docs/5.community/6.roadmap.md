## Release Cycle

Since January 2023, we've adopted a consistent release cycle for **Nuxt 3**, following [semver](https://semver.org). We aim for major framework releases every year, with an expectation of patch releases every week or so and minor releases every month or so. They should never contain breaking changes except within options clearly marked as `experimental`.

### Ongoing Support for Nuxt

Going forward from v3, we commit to support each major version of Nuxt for a minimum of a year after the last release, and to providing an upgrade path for current users at that point.

### Current Packages

The current active version of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) is **v3** which is available as `nuxt` on npm with the `latest` tag.

Nuxt 2 is in maintenance mode and is available on npm with the `2x` tag. It will reach End of Life (EOL) on June 30, 2024.

Each active version has its own nightly releases which are generated automatically. For more about enabling the Nuxt 3 nightly release channel, see [the nightly release channel docs](/docs/guide/going-further/nightly-release-channel).
