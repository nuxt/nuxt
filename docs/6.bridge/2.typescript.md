# TypeScript

## Remove Modules

- Remove `@nuxt/typescript-build`: Bridge enables same functionality
- Remove `@nuxt/typescript-runtime` and `nuxt-ts`: Nuxt 2 has built-in runtime support

## Update `tsconfig.json`

If you are using TypeScript, you can edit your `tsconfig.json` to benefit from auto-generated Nuxt types:

```diff [tsconfig.json]
{
+ "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  }
}
```

::alert
As `.nuxt/tsconfig.json` is generated and not checked into version control, you'll need to generate that file before running your tests. Add `nuxi prepare` as a step before your tests, otherwise you'll see `TS5083: Cannot read file '~/.nuxt/tsconfig.json'`

You may also need to add `@vue/runtime-dom` as a devDependency if you are struggling to get template type inference working with [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar).
::
::alert
Keep in mind that all options extended from `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json` will be overwritten by the options defined in your `tsconfig.json`.
Overwriting options such as `"compilerOptions.paths"` with your own configuration will lead TypeScript to not factor in the module resolutions from `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json`. This can lead to module resolutions such as `#imports` not being recognized.

In case you need to extend options provided by `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json` further, you can use the `alias` property within your `nuxt.config`. `nuxi` will pick them up and extend `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json` accordingly.
