One of the core features of Nuxt is the layers and extending support. You can extend a default Nuxt application to reuse components, utils, and configuration. The layers structure is almost identical to a standard Nuxt application which makes them easy to author and maintain.

## Use Cases

- Share reusable configuration presets across projects using `nuxt.config` and `app.config`
- Create a component library using [`app/components/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/app/components) directory
- Create utility and composable library using [`app/composables/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/app/composables) and [`app/utils/`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/app/utils) directories
- Create Nuxt module presets
- Share standard setup across projects
- Create Nuxt themes
- Enhance code organization by implementing a modular architecture and support Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern in large scale projects.

## Usage

By default, any layers within your project in the `~~/layers` directory will be automatically registered as layers in your project.

::note
Layer auto-registration was introduced in Nuxt v3.12.0.
::

In addition, named layer aliases to the `srcDir` of each of these layers will automatically be created. For example, you will be able to access the `~~/layers/test` layer via `#layers/test`.

::note
Named layer aliases were introduced in Nuxt v3.16.0.
::

In addition, you can extend from a layer by adding the [extends](/docs/api/nuxt-config#extends) property to your [`nuxt.config`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config) file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    '../base',                     // Extend from a local layer
    '@my-themes/awesome',          // Extend from an installed npm package
    'github:my-themes/awesome#v1', // Extend from a git repository
  ]
})
```

You can also pass an authentication token if you are extending from a private GitHub repository:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    // per layer configuration
    ['github:my-themes/private-awesome', { auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN }]
  ]
})
```

::tip
You can override a layer's alias by specifying it in the options next to the layer source.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    [
      'github:my-themes/awesome',
      { 
        meta: {
          name: 'my-awesome-theme',
        },
      },
    ],
  ]
})
```

::

Nuxt uses [unjs/c12](https://c12.unjs.io) and [unjs/giget](https://giget.unjs.io) for extending remote layers. Check the documentation for more information and all available options.

## Layer Priority

When using multiple layers, it's important to understand how they override each other:

1. **Layers in `extends`** - earlier entries have higher priority (first overrides second)
2. **Auto-scanned local layers** from `~~/layers` directory in alphabetical order (Z overrides A)  
3. **Your project** has the highest priority in the stack - it will always override other layers

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    '../base',                     // Highest priority (among extends)
    '@my-themes/awesome',          // Medium priority
    'github:my-themes/awesome#v1', // Lower priority
  ]
  // Your project has the highest priority
})
```

This means if multiple layers define the same component, configuration, or file, the one with higher priority will be used.
