One of the core features of Nuxt is the layers and extending support. You can extend a default Nuxt application to reuse components, utils, and configuration. The layers structure is almost identical to a standard Nuxt application which makes them easy to author and maintain.

## Use Cases

- Share reusable configuration presets across projects using `nuxt.config` and `app.config`
- Create a component library using [`app/components/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/components) directory
- Create utility and composable library using [`app/composables/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/composables) and [`app/utils/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/utils) directories
- Create Nuxt module presets
- Share standard setup across projects
- Create Nuxt themes
- Enhance code organization by implementing a modular architecture and support Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern in large scale projects.

## Usage

By default, any layers within your project in the `~~/layers` directory will be automatically registered as layers in your project.

::note
Layer auto-registration was introduced in Nuxt v3.12.0.
::

In addition, named layer aliases to the `srcDir` of each of these layers will automatically be created. For example, you will be able to access the `~~/layers/test` layer via `#layers/test`.

::note
Named layer aliases were introduced in Nuxt v3.16.0.
::

In addition, you can extend from a layer by adding the [extends](/docs/4.x/api/nuxt-config#extends) property to your [`nuxt.config`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/nuxt-config) file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    // Extend from a local layer
    '../base',
    // Extend from an installed npm package
    '@my-themes/awesome',
    // Extend from a git repository
    'github:my-themes/awesome#v1',
  ],
})
```

You can also pass an authentication token if you are extending from a private GitHub repository:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    // per layer configuration
    ['github:my-themes/private-awesome', { auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN }],
  ],
})
```

::note
If a branch is not specified, this will clone `main`.
::

::tip
You can override a layer's alias by specifying it in the options next to the layer source.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    [
      'github:my-themes/awesome',
      {
        meta: {
          name: 'my-awesome-theme',
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
})
```

::

Nuxt uses [unjs/c12](https://github.com/unjs/c12) and [unjs/giget](https://github.com/unjs/giget) for extending remote layers. Check the documentation for more information and all available options.

## Layer Priority

When using multiple layers, it's important to understand the override order. Layers with **higher priority** override layers with lower priority when they define the same files or components.

The priority order from highest to lowest is:

1. **Your project files** - always have the highest priority
2. **Auto-scanned layers** from `~~/layers` directory - sorted alphabetically (Z has higher priority than A)
3. **Layers in `extends`** config - first entry has higher priority than second

### When to Use Each

- **`extends`** - Use for external dependencies (npm packages, remote repositories) or layers outside your project directory
- **`~~/layers` directory** - Use for local layers that are part of your project

::tip
If you need to control the order of auto-scanned layers, you can prefix them with numbers: `~/layers/1.z-layer`, `~/layers/2.a-layer`. This way `2.a-layer` will have higher priority than `1.z-layer`.
::

### Example

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    // Local layer outside the project
    '../base',
    // NPM package
    '@my-themes/awesome',
    // Remote repository
    'github:my-themes/awesome#v1',
  ],
})
```

If you also have `~~/layers/custom`, the priority order is:
- Your project files (highest)
- `~~/layers/custom`
- `../base`
- `@my-themes/awesome`
- `github:my-themes/awesome#v1` (lowest)

This means your project files will override any layer, and `~~/layers/custom` will override anything in `extends`.
