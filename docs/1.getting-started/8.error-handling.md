# Error Handling

Learn how to catch errors in different lifecycles.

## Handling Errors

Nuxt 3 is a full-stack framework, which means there are several sources of unpreventable user runtime errors that can happen in different contexts:

1. Errors during the Vue rendering lifecycle (SSR + SPA)
1. Errors during API or Nitro server lifecycle
1. Server and client startup errors (SSR + SPA)
1. Errors downloading JS chunks

### Errors During the Vue Rendering Lifecycle (SSR + SPA)

You can hook into Vue errors using [`onErrorCaptured`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle.html#onerrorcaptured).

In addition, Nuxt provides a `vue:error` hook, called when any errors propagate up to the top level.

Using an error reporting framework, you can provide a global handler through [`vueApp.config.errorHandler`](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-errorhandler). It will receive all Vue errors, even if handled.

#### Example With Global Error Reporting Framework

```js
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.config.errorHandler = (error, context) => {
    // ...
  }
})
```

### Server and Client Startup Errors (SSR + SPA)

Nuxt will call the `app:error` hook if there are any errors in starting your Nuxt application.

This includes:

* running Nuxt plugins
* processing `app:created` and `app:beforeMount` hooks
* rendering your Vue app to HTML (on the server)
* mounting the app (on client-side), though you should handle this case with `onErrorCaptured` or with `vue:error`
* processing the `app:mounted` hook

### Errors During API or Nitro Server Lifecycle

You cannot define a server-side handler for these errors now, but you can render an error page (see the next section).

### Errors Downloading JS Chunks

You might encounter chunk-loading errors due to a network connectivity failure or a new deployment (which invalidates your old, hashed JS chunk URLs). Nuxt provides built-in support for handling chunk-loading errors by performing a hard reload when a chunk fails to load during route navigation.

You can change this behavior by setting `experimental.emitRouteChunkError` to `false` (to disable hooking into these errors) or to `manual` if you want to handle them yourself. If handling chunk loading errors manually, you can check out the [the automatic implementation](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/main/packages/nuxt/src/app/plugins/chunk-reload.client.ts) for ideas.

## Rendering an Error Page

When Nuxt encounters a fatal error during the server lifecycle or when rendering your Vue application (SSR and SPA), it will render a JSON response (if requested with an `Accept: application/json` header) or an HTML error page.

You can customize this error page by adding `~/error.vue` in your application's source directory alongside `app.vue`. This page has a single prop `error` which contains an error for you to handle.

When you are ready to remove the error page, you can call the `clearError` helper function, which takes an optional path to redirect to (for example, if you want to navigate to a 'safe' page).

::alert{type="warning"}
Double-check before using anything dependent on Nuxt plugins, such as `$route` or `useRouter`. If a plugin throws an error, it won't re-run until you clear it.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
In Node.js 16, setting cookies when rendering your error page will [overwrite cookies previously set](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20585). We recommend updating, as Node.js 16 will reach end-of-life on September 11th, 2023.

### Example

```vue [error.vue]
<template>
  <button @click="handleError">Clear errors</button>
</template>

<script setup>
const props = defineProps({
  error: Object
})

const handleError = () => clearError({ redirect: '/' })
</script>
```

## Error Helper Methods

### `useError`

* `function useError (): Ref<Error | { url, statusCode, statusMessage, message, description, data }>`

This function will return the global error Nuxt is handling.

### `createError`

* `function createError (err: { cause, data, message, name, stack, statusCode, statusMessage, fatal }): Error`

You can use this function to create an error object with additional metadata. It is usable in the Vue and Nitro portions of your app and is meant to be thrown.

If you throw an error created with `createError`:

* On the server side, it will trigger a full-screen error page which you can clear with `clearError`.
* On the client side, it will throw a non-fatal error for you to handle. If you need to trigger a full-screen error page, use `fatal: true`.

### Example

```vue [pages/movies/[slug].vue]
<script setup>
const route = useRoute()
const { data } = await useFetch(`/api/movies/${route.params.slug}`)
if (!data.value) {
  throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: 'Page Not Found' })
}
</script>
```

### `showError`

* `function showError (err: string | Error | { statusCode, statusMessage }): Error`

You can call this function at any point on the client side or directly (on the server side) within middleware, plugins, or `setup()` functions. It will trigger a full-screen error page which you can clear with `clearError`.

We recommend using `throw createError()` instead.

::

### `clearError`

* `function clearError (options?: { redirect?: string }): Promise<void>`

This function will clear the currently handled Nuxt error. It also takes an optional path to redirect to (for example, if you want to navigate to a 'safe' page).

## Rendering Errors Within Your App

Nuxt also provides a `<NuxtErrorBoundary>` component that allows you to handle client-side errors within your app without replacing your entire site with an error page.

This component is responsible for handling errors that occur within its default slot. On the client side, it will prevent the error from bubbling up to the top level and render the `#error` slot instead.

The `#error` slot will receive `error` as a prop. (If you set `error = null`, it will trigger the re-rendering of the default slot; you'll need to ensure that the error gets resolved first, or the error slot will get rendered a second time.)

::alert{type="info"}
If you navigate to another route, the error will be gone automatically.
::

### Example

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <!-- some content -->
  <NuxtErrorBoundary @error="someErrorLogger">
    <!-- You use the default slot to render your content -->
    <template #error="{ error, clearError }">
      You can display the error locally here: {{ error }}
      <button @click="clearError">
        This will clear the error.
      </button>
    </template>
  </NuxtErrorBoundary>
</template>
```
