## New Project

::alert
  ::details
    :summary[Before getting started, please make sure you have installed the recommended setup:]
    * **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version or above 16.11) ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
    * **Visual Studio Code** ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
    * **Volar Extension** ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)]
      * Either enable [**Take Over Mode**](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#volar-takeover-mode) (recommended)
      * ... or add **TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)** ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)]

    If you have enabled **Take Over Mode** or installed the **TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)**, you can disable generating the shim for `*.vue` files in your `nuxt.config` file:

    ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      typescript: {
        shim: false
      }
    })
    ```
  ::
::

Open a terminal (if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi init <project-name>
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx nuxi init <project-name>
```

::

Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code <project-name>
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [pnpm]
# Make sure you have `shamefully-hoist=true` in `.npmrc` before running pnpm install
pnpm install
```

::

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev -o
```

::

::alert{type=success icon=âœ¨ .font-bold}
Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:3000>.
