# Server Directory 

Nuxt scans files and create middlewares, plugins and API routes to create features to use inside components or pages.

Each file under these folders must return a function defined with `defineEventHandler()`.

## Server Routes

Anything under `~/server/api` folder will create API routes to fetch data within API route.

```ts [server/api/hello.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(() => {
    return {
      greetings: 'traveler'
    }
})
```

```vue [components/Greet.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const {data} = await useFetch('/api/hello')
</script>
```

This server route will return a data object that contains an object with content of `{greetings: 'traveler'}`.

Server route file will automatically match with `GET` method and it can be changed by adding method names to file name such as: `.post`, `.put`, `.delete`. 
Routes may accept parameters, body and query parameters to get some values.
