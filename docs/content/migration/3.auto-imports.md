# Auto Imports

Nuxt 3 adopts a minimal friction approach, meaning wherever possible components and composables are auto-imported.

::alert{type=info}
In the rest of the migration documentation, you will notice that key Nuxt and Vue utilities do not have explicit imports. This is not a typo; Nuxt will automatically import them for you, and you should get full type hinting if you have followed [the instructions](/migration/configuration#typescript) to use Nuxt's TypeScript support.

If you had a more complex setup, then note that the component options have changed somewhat. See the [components documentation](/guide/directory-structure/components) for more information.
