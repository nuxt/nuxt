# Output Directory

Nuxt creates the `.output/` directory when building your application for production.

::alert{type=warning}
You should not touch any files inside since the whole directory will be re-created when running `nuxt build`.
::

Use this directory to deploy your Nuxt application to production. Learn more in our [deployment section](/guide/deploy).
