# Introduction

## ❓ What is Nuxt?

Is it the first time Learning about Nuxt or want to get familiar to the new Concepts or Nuxt 3, then we recommand to read the [Concepts section](/concepts)

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before getting started, please make sure you have installed recommended development software.

* **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version) 👉 [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
* **Visual Studio Code** 👉 [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
* **Volar Extension** 👉 [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)]

<sup>*</sup> If you already have Node.js installed, check with `node --version` to ensure using `v14` or `v16`.

## 🌉 Bridge or Nuxt 3

You must decide if you are starting from scratch or upgrading an existing Nuxt 2 project.

### 🌱 I am starting a fresh Nuxt project

- Enjoy using latest Vue 3
- All of new composables are available
- New templating system and conventions are enabled

👉 You can go to the [Installation section](/getting-started/installation).

### ⬆️ I have an existing Nuxt 2 project

If you have an existing Nuxt 2 project, we **strongly recommend** to start migrating your Nuxt 2 project with Bridge module. This way you can try most of new features without opting-in to more breaking changes.

- It is risk-free! You can roll back by just commenting out one line in config
- Makes your project almost ready for nuxt3 migration
- Enjoy new DX improvements without major rewrites for vue3
- Use nitro engine for platform agnostic and optimized deployments
- Help us stabilize nuxt3 and discover flows
- Bridge is more stable than nuxt3 at the moment for migration

👉 You can go to the [Bridge installation section](/getting-started/bridge).
