## What is Nuxt?

If this is the first time you're learning about Nuxt or you want to get more familiar with Nuxt 3, we recommend you begin by reading the [Concepts section](/concepts).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, please make sure you have installed the recommended setup.

* **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version) 👉 [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
* **Visual Studio Code** 👉 [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
* **Volar Extension** 👉 [[Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)]

<sup>*</sup> If you already have Node.js installed, check with `node --version` that you are using `v14` or `v16`.

## Nuxt 3 or Bridge?

Next, decide whether to start from scratch or upgrade an existing Nuxt 2 project.

### Migrating a Nuxt 2 project

If you have an existing Nuxt 2 project, we **strongly recommend** you begin by using Nuxt Bridge. This way you can try most new features while keeping breaking changes to a minimum.

* It's risk free! You can always remove the module from your config
* Makes your project (almost) ready for Nuxt 3
* Enjoy new DX improvements without major rewrites for Vue 3
* Use Nitro engine for platform-agnostic and optimized deployments
* Help us stabilize Nuxt 3 and discover flaws
