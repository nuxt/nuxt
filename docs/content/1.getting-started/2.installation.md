## New project

Open a terminal, or from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

```bash
npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

Open `nuxt3-app` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code -r nuxt3-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group
```bash [Yarn]
yarn install
```
```bash [NPM]
npm install
```
::

## Development server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start your nuxt app in development mode:

yarn dev -o
```
```bash [NPM]
npm run dev -- -o
```
