## New project

Open a terminal, or from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open an [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and use the following command to create a new starter project:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

```bash [yarn2]
yarn dlx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx nuxi init nuxt3-app
```

::

Open `nuxt3-app` folder in visual studio code:

```bash
code nuxt3-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

::

## Development server

Now you'll be able to use `yarn dev` to start your nuxt app in development mode:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev -o
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev -- -o
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev -- -o
```
