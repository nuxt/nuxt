# Assets directory

The `assets/` directory is used to add all the website assets that will be processed by the build tool (Webpack of Vite).

The directory usually contain such files:
- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't be served from the [`public/`](/docs/directory-structure/public) directory.

If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend to take a look at the [`public/`](/docs/directory-structure/public) directory.
