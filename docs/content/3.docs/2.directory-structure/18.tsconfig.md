# TypeScript configuration file

Nuxt [automatically generates](/concepts/typescript) a `.nuxt/tsconfig.json` file with the resolved aliases you are using in your Nuxt project, as well as with other sensible defaults. You can benefit from this by creating a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json"
}
```

As you need to, you can customize the contents of this file. However, note that if you need to customize your `paths`, this will completely override the auto-generated path aliases. Instead, it is suggested that you add any path aliases you need to the `alias` property within your `nuxt.config`, where they will get picked up and added to the autogenerated `tsconfig`.
