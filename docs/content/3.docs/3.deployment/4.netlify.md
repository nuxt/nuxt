# Netlify

How to deploy Nuxt to Netlify.

::list

- Support for serverless SSR build
- Auto-detected when deploying
- No configuration required
::

## Setup

Nitro will auto-detect that you are in a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) environment and build the correct version of your Nuxt server. For new sites, Netlify will detect that you are using Nuxt 3 or bridge and set the publish directory to `dist` and build command to `npm run build`. If you are upgrading an existing site you should check these and update them if needed.

## Deployment

Just push to your git repository [as you would normally for Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/).

## More information

See [more information on the Lambda preset](/docs/deployment/presets/lambda) for full details.

## Demo

A live demo is available on <https://nitro-demo.netlify.app/>
