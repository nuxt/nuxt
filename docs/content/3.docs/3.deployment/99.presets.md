# Presets

There are four provided generic presets for Nuxt Nitro that you can use out-of-the-box.

1. [Node.js server *(default)*](/deployment/presets/server)
2. [Node.js function](/deployment/presets/node)
3. [Lambda function](/deployment/presets/lambda)
4. [Service worker](/deployment/presets/service-worker)

If you need to [create a custom preset](/deployment/presets/custom), that's possible too. 🚀

You may also want to check out the docs for [platform presets that are supported out-of-the-box](/build/platforms).
