---

The `layers/` directory allows you to organize and share reusable code, components, composables, and configurations across your Nuxt application. Any layers within your project in the `layers/` directory will be automatically registered.

::note
The `layers/` directory auto-registration is available in Nuxt v3.12.0+.
::

::tip{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb"}
Layers are ideal for organizing large codebases with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, creating reusable **UI libraries** or **themes**, sharing **configuration presets** across projects, and separating concerns like **admin panels** or **feature modules**.
::

## Structure

Each subdirectory within `layers/` is treated as a separate layer. A layer can contain the same structure as a standard Nuxt application.

::important
Every layer **must have** a `nuxt.config.ts` file to be recognized as a valid layer, even if it's empty.
::

```bash [Directory structure]
-| layers/
---| base/
-----| nuxt.config.ts
-----| app/
-------| components/
---------| BaseButton.vue
-------| composables/
---------| useBase.ts
-----| server/
-------| api/
---------| hello.ts
---| admin/
-----| nuxt.config.ts
-----| app/
-------| pages/
---------| admin.vue
-------| layouts/
---------| admin.vue
```

## Automatic Aliases

Named layer aliases to the `srcDir` of each layer are automatically created. You can access a layer using the `#layers/[name]` alias:

```ts
// Access the base layer
import something from '#layers/base/path/to/file'

// Access the admin layer
import { useAdmin } from '#layers/admin/composables/useAdmin'
```

::note
Named layer aliases were introduced in Nuxt v3.16.0.
::

## Layer Content

Each layer can include:

- [`nuxt.config.ts`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/nuxt-config) - Layer-specific configuration that will be merged with the main config
- [`app.config.ts`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/app-config) - Reactive application configuration
- [`app/components/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/components) - Vue components (auto-imported)
- [`app/composables/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/composables) - Vue composables (auto-imported)
- [`app/utils/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/utils) - Utility functions (auto-imported)
- [`app/pages/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/pages) - Application pages
- [`app/layouts/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/layouts) - Application layouts
- [`app/middleware/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/middleware) - Route middleware
- [`app/plugins/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/plugins) - Nuxt plugins
- [`server/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/server) - Server routes, middleware, and utilities
- [`shared/`](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/shared) - Shared code between app and server

## Priority Order

When multiple layers define the same component, composable, page, or other resource, the layer with **higher priority wins** and overrides the others.

Layers in the `layers/` directory are sorted alphabetically, with layers that come **later** in alphabetical order having **higher priority** (Z > A).

### Controlling Priority

If you need to control the order, you can prefix layer directories with numbers:

```bash [Directory structure]
layers/
  1.base/
    nuxt.config.ts
  2.features/
    nuxt.config.ts
  3.admin/
    nuxt.config.ts
```

This way `3.admin` will have higher priority than `2.features`, and `2.features` will have higher priority than `1.base`.

### Priority Example

Consider multiple layers defining the same component:

```bash [Directory structure]
layers/
  1.base/
    app/components/Button.vue    # Base button style
  2.theme/
    app/components/Button.vue    # Themed button (overrides base)
  3.admin/
    app/components/Button.vue    # Admin button (overrides theme)
app/
  components/Button.vue          # Project button (overrides all layers)
```

In this case:
- If only layers exist, `3.admin/Button.vue` is used (highest layer priority)
- If `app/components/Button.vue` exists in your project, it overrides all layers

### Complete Priority Order

From highest to lowest priority:

1. **Your project files** - always have the highest priority
2. **Auto-scanned layers** from `layers/` directory - sorted alphabetically (Z > A, 3 > 2 > 1)
3. **Layers in `extends`** config - first entry has higher priority than second

::tip
This pattern is useful for creating base layers with defaults that can be progressively overridden by more specific layers.
