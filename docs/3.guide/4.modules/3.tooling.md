Modules come with a set of first-party tools to help you with their development.

## `@nuxt/module-builder`

[Nuxt Module Builder](https://github.com/nuxt/module-builder#readme) is a zero-configuration build tool taking care of all the heavy lifting to build and ship your module. It ensures proper compatibility of your module build artifact with Nuxt applications.

## `@nuxt/kit`

[Nuxt Kit](/docs/4.x/guide/going-further/kit) provides composable utilities to help your module interact with Nuxt applications. It's recommended to use Nuxt Kit utilities over manual alternatives whenever possible to ensure better compatibility and code readability of your module.

[Nuxt Test Utils](/docs/4.x/getting-started/testing) is a collection of utilities to help set up and run Nuxt applications within your module tests.
