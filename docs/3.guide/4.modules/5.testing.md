Testing helps ensure your module works as expected given various setups. Find in this section how to perform various kinds of tests against your module.

## Write Unit Tests

We're still discussing and exploring how to ease unit and integration testing on Nuxt modules.

## Write E2E Tests

[Nuxt Test Utils](/docs/3.x/getting-started/testing) is the go-to library to help you test your module in an end-to-end way. Here's the workflow to adopt with it:

1. Create a Nuxt application to be used as a "fixture" inside `test/fixtures/*`
2. Setup Nuxt with this fixture inside your test file
3. Interact with the fixture using utilities from `@nuxt/test-utils` (e.g. fetching a page)
4. Perform checks related to this fixture (e.g. "HTML contains ...")
5. Repeat

In practice, the fixture:

```ts [test/fixtures/ssr/nuxt.config.ts]
// 1. Create a Nuxt application to be used as a "fixture"
import MyModule from '../../../src/module'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: true,
  modules: [
    MyModule,
  ],
})
```

And its test:

```ts [test/rendering.ts]
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'
import { $fetch, setup } from '@nuxt/test-utils/e2e'

describe('ssr', async () => {
  // 2. Setup Nuxt with this fixture inside your test file
  await setup({
    rootDir: fileURLToPath(new URL('./fixtures/ssr', import.meta.url)),
  })

  it('renders the index page', async () => {
    // 3. Interact with the fixture using utilities from `@nuxt/test-utils`
    const html = await $fetch('/')

    // 4. Perform checks related to this fixture
    expect(html).toContain('<div>ssr</div>')
  })
})

// 5. Repeat
describe('csr', async () => { /* ... */ })
```

An example of such a workflow is available on [the module starter](https://github.com/nuxt/starter/blob/module/test/basic.test.ts).

## Test Manually

Having a playground Nuxt application to test your module when developing it is really useful. [The module starter integrates one for that purpose](/docs/3.x/guide/modules/getting-started#develop-your-module).

You can test your module with other Nuxt applications (applications that are not part of your module repository) locally. To do so, you can use [`npm pack`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-pack/) command, or your package manager equivalent, to create a tarball from your module. Then in your test project, you can add your module to `package.json` packages as: `"my-module": "file:/path/to/tarball.tgz"`.

After that, you should be able to reference `my-module` like in any regular project.
