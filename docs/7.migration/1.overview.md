# Overview

Nuxt 3 is a complete rewrite of Nuxt 2, and also based on a new set of underlying technologies.

That means there will be significant changes when migrating a Nuxt 2 app to Nuxt 3, although you can expect migration to become more straightforward as we move toward a stable release.

<!--

Nuxt 3 is now in release candidate stage. The main goal of the release candidate stage is to **increase the adoption rate of Nuxt 3** and **increase stability**. However, it is still in continued development. Read more about [Nuxt 3 release candidate status](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/18383).

1. Moving from webpack 4 and Babel to Vite or webpack 5 and esbuild.
1. Moving from a runtime Nuxt dependency to a minimal, standalone server compiled with nitropack.
