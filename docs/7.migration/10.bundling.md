# Build Tooling

We use the following build tools by default:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

For this reason, most of your previous `build` configuration in `nuxt.config` will now be ignored, including any custom babel configuration.

If you need to configure any of Nuxt's build tools, you can do so in your `nuxt.config`, using the new top-level `vite`, `webpack` and `postcss` keys.

In addition, Nuxt ships with TypeScript support. [Find out more](/docs/guide/concepts/typescript).

## Steps

1. Remove `@nuxt/typescript-build` and `@nuxt/typescript-runtime` from your dependencies and modules.
1. Remove any unused babel dependencies from your project.
1. Remove any explicit core-js dependencies.
1. Migrate `require` to `import`.
